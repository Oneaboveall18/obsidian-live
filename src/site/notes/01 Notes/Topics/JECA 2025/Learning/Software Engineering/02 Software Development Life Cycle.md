In a SDLC the development is tracked in a systematic and disciplined manner. It will define the entry and exit for every stage. It makes assessment possible, time prediction, cost prediction, scheduling to identify faults as early as possible

# Stage-1: Planning and Requirement Analysis

It is the first and most important phase of SDLC. It involves collecting and analyzing software requirements through client inputs, surveys, and research. The results are documented in the Software Requirement Specification (SRS), and a project plan is created with timelines, costs, and risk assessment. This stage ensures the team clearly understands the project scope, setting a strong foundation for development.

# Stage-2: Defining Requirements

In this stage, all the requirements for the target software are specified. These requirements get approval from customers, market analysts, and stakeholders.   
This is fulfilled by utilizing SRS (Software Requirement Specification). This is a sort of document that specifies all those things that need to be defined and created during the entire project cycle.

# Stage-3: Designing Architecture

**SRS** is a reference for software designers to come up with the best architecture for the software. Hence, with the requirements defined in SRS, multiple designs for the product architecture are present in the Design Document Specification (DDS). 
This DDS is assessed by market analysts and stakeholders. After evaluating all the possible factors, the most practical and logical design is chosen for development.

# Stage-4: Developing Product

At this stage, the fundamental development of the product starts. For this, developers use a specific programming code as per the design in the DDS. Hence, it is important for the coders to follow the protocols set by the association. Conventional programming tools like compilers, interpreters, debuggers, etc. are also put into use at this stage. Some popular languages like C/C++, Python, Java, etc. are put into use as per the software regulations.

# Stage-5: Product Testing and Integration

After the development of the product, testing of the software is necessary to ensure its smooth execution. Although, minimal testing is conducted at every stage of SDLC. Therefore, at this stage, all the probable flaws are tracked, fixed, and retested. This ensures that the product confronts the quality requirements of SRS. 

**Documentation, Training, and Support:*** Software documentation is an essential part of the software development life cycle. A well-written document acts as a tool and means to information repository necessary to know about software processes, functions, and maintenance. Documentation also provides information about how to use the product. Training in an attempt to improve the current or future employee performance by increasing an employee's ability to work through learning, usually by changing his attitude and developing his skills and understanding.

# Stage-6: Deployment and Maintenance of Products

After detailed testing, the conclusive product is released in phases as per the organization’s strategy. Then it is tested in a real industrial environment. It is important to ensure its smooth performance. If it performs well, the organization sends out the product as a whole. After retrieving beneficial feedback, the company releases it as it is or with auxiliary improvements to make it further helpful for the customers. However, this alone is not enough. Therefore, along with the deployment, the product's supervision.
