Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the development, operation, and maintenance of software. It focuses on producing high-quality software that is reliable, efficient, maintainable, and meets user requirements within time and budget constraints. This discipline encompasses a structured and disciplined approach to software development, using defined methodologies, tools, and techniques to manage software projects effectively.

**Program:** A step by step instructions to perform a specific task
**Software:** It is a **program** along with proper documentation (requirements analysis, design, coding and testing)

# Software Crisis

The **software crisis** refers to the set of problems encountered during the development and maintenance of software systems, especially as they became larger and more complex, starting in the late 1960s.

# Characteristics of Software

1. No Physical Wear and Tear
2. Easy to make than Hardware
3. Custom Built Nature
4. Intangibility

# Major Problems

1. Ambiguous or incomplete requirements
2. Lack of communication between stakeholders
3. Poor Project Management
4. Insufficient Time and Budget
5. Lack of Skilled Personnel
6. Resistance to Change

# Generic View of Process

![[Incremental-Process-Model.webp\|Incremental-Process-Model.webp]]

The **generic view of a process** in software engineering refers to the **basic framework** that is common to **all software development processes**. It outlines the **core activities** that are performed regardless of the specific process model (like Waterfall, Agile, Spiral, etc.).

## **Key Activities in the Generic Process Framework:**

1. **Communication**
    - Understanding **what the customer wants**.
    - Includes requirements gathering, stakeholder meetings, and feasibility discussions.
2. **Planning**
    - Estimating **resources**, **time**, and **cost**.    
    - Creating a **project plan** with schedules, milestones, and risk management.
        
3. ### **Modeling (Design & Analysis)**
    
    - Analyzing requirements and **designing the architecture** of the software.
        
    - May include data models, flow diagrams, and UI/UX design.
        
4. ### **Construction (Coding & Testing)**
    
    - **Actual coding** of the software system.
        
    - Simultaneously or later, **testing** is done to identify and fix bugs.
        
5. ### **Deployment**
    
    - Delivering the software to the end-users.
        
    - Involves installation, training, feedback collection, and **maintenance**.
